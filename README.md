# Digital Learning: Tools and Resources
Dr. J. Berenike Herrmann

## Resources Text Analysis in Talk "Digital Learning" (3 Feb 2020) and Lesson "Contemporary German Civilization: Cultures and Conflict in Modernity" (4 Feb 2020)

### DiaCollo 
- Diachronic Collocation Analysis (DiaCollo, Bryan Jurish) using a range of corpora from the DWDS (Deutsches Textarchiv [DTA], Press corpus, and others)
- Tutorial: http://kaskade.dwds.de/diacollo-tutorial/#introduction.html
- (German) Discussion with examples in ForText: https://fortext.net/ressourcen/textsammlungen/dwds-digitales-woerterbuch-der-deutschen-sprache 

### TextGrid Repository with Voyant
- go to https://textgridrep.org/repository.html
- select your text by clicking on the author and then down through the subfolders - until you reach the text: Here's Franz Kafka's novel fragment "Der Prozess" https://textgridrep.org/browse/-/browse/qmx4_0
- else, you can use the "search function" for selecting your text.
- when you're at the full text level, you see a tool bar "Werkzeug" to the left of the text. Here select: "Voyant v2".
- Now, the text analysis suite "Voyant" opens, loading your text! 
- (you can also access Voyant directly: https://voyant-tools.org/, for example when you wish to upload to analyze multiple texts simultaneously).

### A superuseful application in teaching German L2
- one application of both DiaCollo and Voyant is to explore the meaning of new words the students learn.
- here, the KEYWORD IN CONTEXT function reveals the keyword in its multiple textual contexts in the chosen corpus. Through this, different shades of meaning become visible and can be compared.
- in __DiaCollo__, you can enter a term like "Krise" or one like "anzapfen", and with the "cloud" function first of all look at its meaning in discourse through time. As the tutorial explains, the students will be able to choose from different reference corpora and look at the cooccurring terms. By clicking on the word cloud terms, more information about frequency becomes available. Most important for our means is the button called __"search:	KWIC"__: it depicts the search term with its left and right neighbors in specific instances.
- in __Voyant__ the KWIC function can be found at the lower right side of the graphical user interface: the __"contexts"__ tool. Any term of interest can be entered (at the bottom of the "contexts" tool, and its left and right neighbors be revealed.
