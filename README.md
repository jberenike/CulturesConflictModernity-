# Digital Learning: Tools and Resources

## Resources Text Analysis in Talk "Digital Learning" (3 Feb 2020) and Lesson "Contemporary German Civilization: Cultures and Conflict in Modernity" (4 Feb 2020)

### DiaCollo 
- Diachronic Collocation Analysis (DiaCollo, Bryan Jurish) using a range of corpora from the DWDS (Deutsches Textarchiv [DTA], Press corpus, and others)
- Tutorial: http://kaskade.dwds.de/diacollo-tutorial/#introduction.html
- (German) Discussion with examples in ForText: https://fortext.net/ressourcen/textsammlungen/dwds-digitales-woerterbuch-der-deutschen-sprache 

### TextGrid Repository with Voyant
- go to https://textgridrep.org/repository.html
- select your text by clicking on the author and then down through the subfolders - until you reach the text: Here's Franz Kafka's novel fragment "Der Prozess" https://textgridrep.org/browse/-/browse/qmx4_0
- else, you can use the "search function" for selecting your text.
- when you're at the full text level, you see a tool bar "Werkzeug" to the left of the text. Here select: "Voyant v2".
- Now, the text analysis suite "Voyant" opens, loading your text! 
- (you can also access Voyant directly: https://voyant-tools.org/, for example when you wish to upload to analyze multiple texts simultaneously).

### A superuseful application in teaching German L2
- one application of both DiaCollo and Voyant is to explore the meaning of new words the students learn, for example, "Krise" or "anzapfen". 
- to this aim, the KEYWORD IN CONTEXT function will reveal the search term in its multiple textual contexts. Through this, different shades of meaning become visible and can be compared.
- the corpora can be the larger collections from the DWDS (DiaCollo) or any text or collection of texts determined by the course (if available in TextGrid, see above).
- How it works -->
- in __DiaCollo__, you can enter a term like "Krise" or one like "anzapfen". The "cloud" function will basically show the term and its signifcantly co-occurring terms through time (see tutorial). In order to go to the __KWIC__ function, the students have to click directly on the terms represented in the word cloud, so a box with more information about frequency opens up. Within this box, they click the button called __"search:	KWIC"__: this will reveal instances of the search term with its left and right neighbors.
- in __Voyant__ the KWIC function can be found at the lower right side of the graphical user interface: the __"contexts"__ tool. Any term of interest can be entered (at the bottom of the "contexts" tool, and its left and right neighbors be revealed.
